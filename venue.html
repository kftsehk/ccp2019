                    <p>
                        The Jumbo Kingdom is an important member of Melco's Leisure &
                        Entertainment unit. Centred on the Jumbo and Tai Pak Floating Restaurants in Aberdeen Harbour,
                        it is an internationally renowned tourist attraction. As a Hong Kong icon and a premier tourism
                        and fine-dining establishment, Jumbo has regularly been upgraded over the past 30 years. Jumbo
                        recently had a multi-million dollar refurbishment which not only gave the Jumbo a new look, but
                        also transformed it into a theme park on the sea. Jumbo Kingdom is now a modern complex of
                        dining, sightseeing and cultural attractions - a required stop in any tour of Hong Kong.
